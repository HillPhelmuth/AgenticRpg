**Magic Systems: Theurgic and Arcane Magic**

### A. Theurgic Magic (Divine/Clerical)

**Magic Source:**
Theurgic magic originates from divine favor and the power granted by celestial beings or deities. This magic flows through devoted clerics, priests, and paladins who act as conduits for their chosen deity's will. Theurgic magic is limited by the character's devotion and alignment with their deity’s values. As a result, misuse or deviation from divine tenets may weaken or entirely cut off access to these spells. 

**Magic Alignment:**
Theurgic magic is inherently tied to the character's alignment and their deity's domain. Characters must adhere to their deity's moral and ethical guidelines to maintain their magical abilities. Straying from this path can result in a loss of spells or even divine retribution. Thus there are two types of theurgic magic users: "Light" and "Shadow".

### Shadow Aligned Spell Lists by Level Band

Here is a corresponding list of spells for "Shadow" aligned Clerics, designed to mirror the mechanics of the Light list while inverting the flavor to focus on entropy, darkness, and necromancy.

### B. Arcane Magic (Mage/Wizardly)

**Magic Source:**
Arcane magic stems from the manipulation of ambient magical energies that permeate the world. This magic is accessed through rigorous study, mental discipline, and the mastery of ancient texts or forgotten lore. Arcane casters, such as wizards and sorcerers, rely on intelligence and precision to control these forces. Arcane magic often requires components, incantations, and careful preparation, making it vulnerable to disruption but highly versatile in nature.
