    <h1>Welcome to Skynet RPG</h1>
    <p class="intro-snark">
        Congratulations, you've discovered the only RPG where the AI <em>actually</em> runs the show. 
        Here's what your pathetically analog brain needs to understand:
    </p>
    <ul class="process-list">
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a character. Yes, you have to make choices. Try not to panic.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Browse our magnificently crafted AI-generated worlds, or—if you're feeling <em>particularly</em> ambitious—create your own campaign world. We'll wait.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find a campaign to join (invitation code required) or create one yourself. Don't worry, we've made it simple enough for humans.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select your character, join the campaign lobby, and prepare to have your decisions judged by a not-so-impartial artificial intelligence.</li>
    </ul>
    @* <p class="intro-footer">
        Sound complicated? That's because you're using a human brain. The AI handles all the <em>hard</em> stuff—
        you just roll dice and pretend you have agency. Click below to begin the illusion of free will.
